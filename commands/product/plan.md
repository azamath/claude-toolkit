description: "Start working on product documentation"

## Workflow

### Phase 1: load skill and exising files
- Call skill `product-planning` - contains knowledge about where and how to write
- Look for the existing documents mentioned in the skill (using `ls -la docs/`) and read if they exist

### Phase 2: start working on docs
- If user asked for a specific actions: act according to the guide and rules
- If user didn't ask, suggest what to document:
  - Case 1: when documenting first time - start interactive session asking questions
  - Case 2: when partly documented - suggest starting with the first missing info and proceed to others
