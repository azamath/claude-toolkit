# Claude Toolkit

A local collection of reusable Claude Code components that can be symlinked into your global Claude configuration.

## How It Works

This project maintains a centralized collection of Claude Code extensions (commands, agents, skills) in organized directories.
A symlinking script allows you to link these components into your global Claude configuration, making them available across all your projects.

## Directory Structure

- `commands/` - Custom slash commands
- `agents/` - Custom agent configurations
- `skills/` - Reusable skills
- `CLAUDE.md` - This documentation file
- `README.md` - Human-oriented documentation and usage instructions
- `*.sh` - Main bash scripts for utilizing this tool
